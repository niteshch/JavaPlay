# Play

Play is a high-productivity Java and Scala web application framework that integrates the components and APIs you need for modern web application development.

Play is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture and features predictable and minimal resource consumption (CPU, memory, threads) for highly-scalable applications thanks to its reactive model, based on Akka Streams.
